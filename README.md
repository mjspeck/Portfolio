## [Indeed - webscraping](https://github.com/mjspeck/webscraping-indeed)  

This is a project in Python involving webscraping, data cleaning, NLP, and classification. I scraped data science-related job listings and gathered info such as job title, company, location, and salary, then built a random forest model to predict whether a given job listing would be above or below the median job listing.

## [Terrorism](https://github.com/mjspeck/gtd-terrorism)  

This project is ongoing and involves exploring the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/).  

## [Spotify](https://github.com/mjspeck/spotify)  

I use the [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) library to gather data from the Spotify API. This project is ongoing.
